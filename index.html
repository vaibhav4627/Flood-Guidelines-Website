	<p class="para1">Floods are the most common and widespread of all natural disasters, except fire. 
	Dam failures are potentially the worst flood events. A dam failure is usually the result of neglect, poor design, or structural damage caused by a major event such as an earthquake.
	When a dam fails, a gigantic quantity of water is suddenly let loose downstream, destroying anything in its path.

Flood waters can be extremely dangerous. 
The force of six inches of swiftly moving water can knock people off their feet. 
The best protection during a flood is to leave the area and go to shelter on higher ground.</p></div>
